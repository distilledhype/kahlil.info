title: "Descriptive 22: Building Abstractions That Aren't Ahistorical with Ashley Williams"

> Kahlil and Henning talk to Ashley Williams about her introduction to computers and programming with Logo and HyperCard. Ashley explains how her degrees in philosophy and neuroscience help her reason about program architecture and where her interest in teaching comes from. She becomes the lead instructor at Flatiron School after being rejected as a student, which leads to many different teaching and speaking engagements. Before taking a position at npm, Inc. she also worked at Mozilla and Bocoup.

Ashley's passion for teaching is remarkable. Next to some funny moments where we were a little intimidated by her intelligence, you will find lots of interesting insights about the parallels of philosophy and programming in this episode.
